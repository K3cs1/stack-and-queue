# Stack & Queue Fundamentals
A collection of exercises focusing on Stack (LIFO) and Queue (FIFO) data structures in TypeScript.

## Data Structures

### Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out)
Like a stack of plates:
- You add (push) new plates on top
- You remove (pop) plates from the top
- You can only access the top plate

### Queue (FIFO - First In, First Out)
Like people standing in line:
- New people join (enqueue) at the end of the line
- People leave (dequeue) from the front of the line
- You can only access the first person in line

## Installation
```bash
npm install
```
